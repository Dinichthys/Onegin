‘My uncle keeps to honest systems: By falling ill yet not in jest,
He made me love him with insistence And couldn’t find some better test.
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, it’s quite distressing
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!’

May be, you rose from the clans In those places, or have dears,
Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,
